Workrave runs on GNU/Linux and Microsoft Windows. The GNU/Linux version depends
on Gnome, whereas the Windows version is ported using the GTK toolkit.

The design of the program has a clear separation between the GUI front-end and
the core back-end, making ports to other environments (e.g. KDE) childs play:
the programmer only needs to hook up a few windows. He does not have to worry
about timers and input monitoring, all that is taken care of by the core.
