Q:What are good values for the micropause, restbreak and daily limit timers?

A:The main problem here is that the settings that are required are different
from person to person.

For example, people who are recovering from RSI may use workrave with a 25
second micropause every two and a half minute, and a 10 minute restbreak every
20 minutes. And as they recover, they change the settings to fewer breaks.

If you have never had any problem at all (using the computer, that is), then you
may want much fewer breaks, say 10 seconds micropause every 10 minutes, and a 5
minute restbreak every hour. It is very hard to give proper guidelines here. The
best advice we can give is to play around and see what works for you. Which
settings "feel right". Basically, that's how Workrave's defaults evolved.
