Q:Uninstallation fails on Windows because the program is still running. How do I proceed?

A:Workrave should automatically quit before uninstallation. If this somehow
fails, you need to quit Workrave manually by right clicking the little status
window (or sheep icon in the system tray) to open the menu. Select "Quit", and
then run the uninstaller.
