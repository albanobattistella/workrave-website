Q:I really like your software, do you accept donations?

A:I am glad that you like our software. We appreciate any donations, however, we
prefer donations on a meta-level. Meaning, instead of donating directly to us,
free software authors, we feel it is a better idea to donate to a foundation
that ensures that the conditions amongst which free software can flourish remain
valid. Therefore, I would like you to donate to the Electronic Frontier
Foundation directly. Please visit [EFF](https://secure.eff.org/) -- you'll find
paypal (a.o.) links there.
