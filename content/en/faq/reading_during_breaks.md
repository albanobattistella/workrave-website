Q:Could you implement support for reading the screen during a break?

A:We often receive requests from users that would like to keep on reading the
screen during a micropause. Think of implementing support for transparent
micropause windows, or making the micropause window position configurable. No.
Really, you should not be reading the screen during a micropause. Adding support
for the requested feature defeats the purpose of Workrave. Relax your eyes, and
stare past the monitor during a micropause. Even if you are not suffering from
eyestrain, please keep in mind that staying put in the same position while
reading the screen is not good for your wrists as well. By staying in the same
position you restrict the bloodflow to your arms, which increases their tension
recovery time.
