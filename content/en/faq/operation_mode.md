Q:What is the difference between normal, quiet and suspended mode?

A:Normal "Normal" mode is for normal usage. It will prompt you to break and, if
so configured, force you to take the break. Quiet "Quiet" mode is pretty much
like normal mode, in that it will still register your activity, and notice that
you need to take a break, but it will not actually prompt you to take one, nor
block you from using the computer. This is typically used when you want to show
something on your computer to someone else. You are using the computer doing the
explaining and the showing, but you do not want to be interrupted by breaks.
Once you return to normal mode, Workrave will bother you with taking an
"overdue" break, if necessary Suspended In "Suspended" mode, workrave no longer
records your activity. This is typically used when someone else is using your
computer for a brief time. In these cases, you may not want to quit workrave,
and you also don't want the activity recorded, because it isn't yours, and hence
you will not need to take any "overdue" breaks. When someone else is using the
computer for a longer time, it is best to quit workrave altogether.
