On Windows and several Linux desktop environments, Workrave can show the timers
in the status bar or panel. This way the timers are always visible
without using precious space on your screen.

Currently, this is supported on the following platforms:

- [Cinnamon](cinnamon)

- [Gnome](gnome)

- [KDE](kde)

- [MATE](mate)

- [Windows](windows)

- [Xfce](xfce)
