On Windows, Workrave supports a toolbar that shows all timer values in the
status bar. This toolbar can be enabled by right clicking in the status bar. In
the popup menu that appears, go to the `Toolbars` menu and select `Workrave`:

The Workrave toolbar will appear in the status bar. If Workrave is not running,
only a sheep icon is shown.

The two vertical bars on the left can be used to move the Workrave toolbar in the status
bar. If the handle bars are not visible, the taskbar needs to be unlocked. Right
click on the Workrave toolbar and unselect `Lock the taskbar`.
