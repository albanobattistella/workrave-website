In the Gnome Shell desktop environment, a Workrave applet that shows all timer values can be added to a panel. This applet can be added by starting the `gnome-tweaks` application. In the `Extensions` page, enable the Workrave extension:

![Enable Gnome Shell applet](/images/screenshots/gnome-shell-applet-activate.png)

The Workrave applet will now appear in panel.
