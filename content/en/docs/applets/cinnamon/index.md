title: Cinnamon applet
---

In the Cinnamon desktop environment, a Workrave applet that shows all timer values can be added to a panel.
This applet can be added by right clicking in the panel. In the popup menu, select `Add applets to the panel`:

![Enable Cinnamon applet](/images/screenshots/cinnamon-applet-activate-1.png#center)

In the window that appears, select Workrave and click on the `+` button:

![Enable Cinnamon applet](/images/screenshots/cinnamon-applet-activate-2.png#center)

The Workrave applet will now appear in panel.

Note that if you are using Workrave from the Ubuntu [Workrave PPA](download/ubuntu), you have to install the `workrave-cinnamon` package.
