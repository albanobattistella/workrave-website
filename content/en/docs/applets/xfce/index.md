title: Xfce applet
---

In the [Xfce](https://www.xfce.org/) desktop environment, a Workrave applet that shows all timer values can be added to a panel.
This applet can be added by right clicking in the panel. In the popup menu, from the `Panel` menu select `Add new items...`:

![Enable Xfce applet](/images/screenshots/xfce-applet-activate-1.png#center)

In the window that appears, select Workrave and click on the `Add` button:

![Enable Xfce applet](/images/screenshots/xfce-applet-activate-2.png#center)

The Workrave applet will now appear in panel.

Note that if you are using Workrave from the Ubuntu [Workrave PPA](download/ubuntu), you have to install the `workrave-xfce` package.
