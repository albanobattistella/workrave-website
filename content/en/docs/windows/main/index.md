The main window shows the status of all breaks.
Each bar represents one break. From top to bottom: the microbreak, restbreak and daily limit.
Note that breaks that are disabled are not shown.

The time in each bar indicates the number of hours, minutes and seconds until the next break.
The blue bar indicates your 'Active Time', the amount of time you actively used your computer (by using the mouse of keyword).
When the blue bar is completely full, it is time to take a break. Note that the Active Time only increases as long as you are using keyword or mouse.

The amount of time it takes to get the blue bar completely full is called the "Time between breaks" and is configurable.

The green bar indicates your 'Idle Time', and counts the time you are resting.
The green bar only increases when you are not using keyword and mouse.
As soon as you start using keyword or mouse, your 'Idle Time' resets and te green bar disappears

When the green bar is completely full, you have taken a break.
The amount of time it takes to get the green bar completely full is called the "Break Duration" and is configurable.
In the screenshot below you can see a green bar on top of the blue bar for the microbreak.

When you have rested enough (when the green bar is full), the timer resets and the blue bar disappears, 4 minutes, 30 seconds until the next break.

An orange bar indicates you have been ignoring a break. Workrave calls this an 'Overdue' break. 
The time in the bar becomes negative. In this case, the user has been ignoring the break for 38 seconds.
