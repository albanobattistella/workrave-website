title: Tray icon

On Windows and some Linux desktop environments, Workrave will show a white sheep icon in the status bar, or panel.
This icon can be used to access Workrave's [menu](/docs/menus).

On Windows, you can find the icon in the lower right corner of the screen. You can right click on the icon to access the menu:

This menu has one additional menu item compared the the menu from the main window: `Open`.
The `Open` menu item will open the main window in case it is closed.

Windows may have hidden the Workrave icon. In that case, right click on the upward pointing triangle.
