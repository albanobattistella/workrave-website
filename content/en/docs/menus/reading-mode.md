title: Reading Mode
---
Workrave has a special mode for reading. During reading, you usually do not use the keyboard and mouse.
Therefore, Workrave will assume you are not using the computer and will not ask you to take breaks.
When the reading mode is active, Workrave will also remind you to take breaks while reading.

In reading mode, Workrave will start the break timers as soon as you start using keyboard or mouse.
The timers will keep running until the first rest break, even if you stop using the keyboard and mouse.
During this time you will be reminded to take microbreaks.
After the first restbreak, the break timers stop until you start using keyboard and mouse again.
Then it all starts over.

Related to the Reading Node is the [Operation Mode](../operation-mode).
