Workrave has three different operation modes that can be selected from the menu:

![Menu - Operation Mode](/images/screenshots/menu-main-operation-mode.png)

#### Normal

Workrave will monitor your keyboard and mouse use, and will remind you to take breaks.

#### Quiet

Workrave will monitor your keyboard and mouse use, but will *not* remind you to take breaks.
This can be used, for example, when giving a presentation and you don't want to be interrupted by a break.

#### Suspended

Workrave will *not* monitor your keyboard and mouse use, and will also *not* remind you to take breaks.
This can be used, for example, when someone else is using your computer.

Related to the Operation Node is the [Reading Mode](../reading-mode).
