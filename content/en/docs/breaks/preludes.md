title: Break announcements
---

When it is time to take a break, Workave will first gently announce the break by
means of a small non-intrusive window. This window will automatically move out
of the way if you choose to ignore it, for exmple to finish your current
activity.

After about 20 seconds of ignoring the break announcement, the window will start
flashing orange.

A few seconds later it will starting flashing red. If you still continu to
ignore it, the announcement window will disappear. Depending on your settings
and the number of times you ignored the break, Workrave will eiher forcedly
start the break, or try again in a few minutes.
