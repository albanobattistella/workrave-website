Workrave frequently reminds you take at break from your computer. Workrave supports three kind of breaks:

- Microbreaks

  Microbreaks are short breaks that occur frequently. Typically, every 3 minutes you get a microbreak that lasts about 30 seconds.
  The extact duration and frequency of a microbreak is configurable. During a microbreak you can let go of keyboard and mouse, look away from the screen, and relax a bit.

- Restbreaks

  A restbreak is a longer break that occurs less frequently, Typically, these breaks last about 10 minutes and occur every 45 minutes.
  During a rest break you can walk around, stretch, and relax.

- Daily limit

  Workrave keeps track of the amount of time you use your computer.
  When you have reach the configured daily computer usage limit, you are prompted to stop using the computer for the day.

Each break has a timer that counts the amount of time you are using the computer.
This timer starts when you start using the keyboard or mouse and keeps running as long as you are using keyboard or mouse.
As soon as you stop using the keyboard or mouse, the timer stops.
When the timer reaches the configured 'time between breaks', you are prompted to take a break.
The timer resets when you have not been using keyboard and mouse for duration of the break.

When it is time to take a break, Workrave presents a gentle non-obtrusive reminder.
This reminder automatically moves out-of-the way, which allows you to finish your activity before the break starts.
If you ignore the reminder for more than 30 seconds, the reminder window will disappear.
Depending on configuration and the amount of times you ignored a break Workrave will either force you to take the break, or try again a few minutes later.
