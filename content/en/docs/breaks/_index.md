Workrave supports three kind of breaks:

- Microbreaks

- Restbreaks

- Daily limit

## Break announcement

When it is time to take a break, Workave will first gently announce the break by
means of a small non-intrusive window. This window will automatically move out
of the way if you choose to ignore it, for exmple to finish your current
activity.

## Breaks

Each break type has a different break window. All breaks windows have a postpone and skip button.
