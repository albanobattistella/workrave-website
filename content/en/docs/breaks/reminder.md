title: Break reminder
---

When it is time to take a break, Workave will first gently announce the break by
means of a small non-intrusive window. This window will automatically move out
of the way if you choose to ignore it, for example to finish your current
activity.

After about 20 seconds of ignoring the break reminder, the window will start
flashing orange.

A few seconds later it will start flashing red. If you still continue to
ignore it, the break reminder window will disappear. Depending on your settings
and the number of times you ignored the break, Workrave will either force you to
take the break, or try again in a few minutes.

Similar reminders will be given for restbreaks:
