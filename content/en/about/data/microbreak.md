Workrave frequently reminds you take a short microbreak.
Typically, every 3 minutes you get a microbreak that lasts about 30 seconds.
The exact duration and frequency of a microbreak is fully configurable.
During a microbreak you can let go of keyboard and mouse, look away from the screen, and relax a bit.
