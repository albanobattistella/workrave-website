When it is time to take a break, Workrave presents a gentle non-obtrusive reminder.
This reminder automatically moves out of the way, which allows you to finish your activity before the break starts.
If you ignore the reminder for more than 30 seconds, Workrave will either force you to take the break, or try again a few minutes later.
This behavior is fully configurable.
