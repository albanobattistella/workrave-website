The timer window shows the progress of all three breaks.
For each break it shows the time remaining until the next break.
Using different colors, it also shows when a break is due (blue), how long you have been resting (green), and if you have been ignoring a break (orange).

To save space on your desktop, you can also embed an 'applet' in the taskbar.
