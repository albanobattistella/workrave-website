Workrave uses `GNU gettext` for dealing with translations. Translating Workrave
boils down to providing a translated text for each and every English text used
in Workrave. All of the texts to be translated are listed in one file (.po). For
each text you need to provide the translation by inserting it in that very same
.po file. Translating can be a very tedious job. Luckily there is tooling
available to help you. For example, for GNU/Linux, there is `kbabel`,
`gtranslator` and many others. For Windows, there is `poEdit`. And for
GNU/Emacs, there is the excellent M-x po-mode. So first, 'll have to pick any of
the above tools, depending on the platform you are working on. Install that tool
first, and get acquainted with it. From that point on, you can start translating
using the .po files over at: http://github.com/rcaelers/workrave/blob/master/po/
