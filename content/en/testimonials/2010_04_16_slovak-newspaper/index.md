I would like to thank you for your work on windows version of WorkRave
and its development. I feel fine while using it. I helps me a lot not to
forget about rest and training.

So I had to do something to pay you back. I have written an article
focusing on it published in the most read Slovak newspaper. About 260
thousands copies sold. Here is [online

Thanks again, Milan Gigel / independent IT writer
