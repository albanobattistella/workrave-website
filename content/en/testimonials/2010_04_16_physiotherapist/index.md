Workrave is a very handy little app.

I broke my back in a work accident several years ago - whilst I still
retain the ability to walk, I constantly experience pain ranging from
manageable to incapacitatingly agonising. As such, I regularly visit a
local physio-the-rapist (who also does accupuncture.)

One of the things he berates me for, is how long I sit at the computer.
Of course, being in IT (now - I don't do physical labour anymore) I
spend a minimum of 14 hours in front of a computer, usually closer to
20. (It *is* my hobby too, after all!)

I started using Workrave and even showed it to him. He's since stopped
torturing me as much during my visits.
