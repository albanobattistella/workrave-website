Thanks for Workrave. It's spreading like a virus at my workplace. I
publicly praised Workrave in a newspaper column I wrote recently:

"Take breaks. Grinding away at a task for hours on end, you'll lose
perspective and eyesight. As Lincoln said, if he had to chop down a
tree, he'd take breaks to sharpen his ax. I use a free computer program
called Workrave (www.workrave.org) to remind me to look away from the
screen and walk around every so often. Just knowing that a nap, a
vacation, or a meal is on the horizon can make me more productive and
not look for excuses to take little breaks all the time."
