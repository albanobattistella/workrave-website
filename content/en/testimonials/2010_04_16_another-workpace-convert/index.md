Being a Windows user, I have been a registered user of WorkPace for over
2 years. I discovered you app about 4 months ago and fell in love with
it. It offered virtually everything that Workpace offered and more.
Considering that Workpace only released one trivial update (no
noticeable feature, just some random bug) to their app within those two
years I was happy to leave it behind me.
