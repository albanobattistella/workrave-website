Workrave 1.9.4 has been released. It features keyboard shortcuts on break
windows and a number of other small improvements. Furthermore, a number of
crashes have been fixed and hibernate/standby should now be handled properly on
Windows 7.

## Improvements

- The skip and postpone button now have keyboard shortcuts (Alt-S and Alt-P in
  the English version).
- The automatic start of a restbreak when the screen is locked is now
  configurable.
- On Windows, Workrave shows a reminder balloon when Workrave starts up in
  suspended or quiet mode.
- The (un)installer now automatically shuts down Workrave before
  (un)installation.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed crash when the 'mute all audio during breaks' option is enabled.
- Fixed issue where Workrave remains suspended after hibernate/standby on Window
  7.
- Fixed issue where the reading mode was reset after changing settings.
- It is no longer possible to disable both the notification icon and the main
  window.
