Soon the European Commission is going to vote a revised version of the European
Patentability rules. Your support is needed.
<!--more-->

The proposed revision contains a set of serious challenges to Open Source
development since regulation regarding software patents will be broadly extended
and might forbid independent development of innovative (Open Source and not)
software-based solutions. For further information please see
<http://swpat.ffii.org> and <http://petition.eurolinux.org>. Please show your
support there.
