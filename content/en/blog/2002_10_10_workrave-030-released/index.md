Workrave 0.3.0 is here, with sound support and preliminary network support.
<!--more-->

Added sound support. For office PCs that do not have a sound card, you can
choose to play sounds through the internal PC speaker. Also new, but still
experimental, is distribution support, dubbed "The Collective". You can now
create a network of Workrave instances running on several computers. All
instances that are part of the collective share the same timer information,
meaning that if one computer informs you to take a break, it is futile to flee
to another computer as it will also tell you to take a break. Furthermore, some
nasty crashes in the Windows version were fixed.
