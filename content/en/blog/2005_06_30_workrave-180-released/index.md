Finally, at long last, 1.8.0 has arrived. Long overdue, but still within the one
year period since the last release: Workrave now gives additional feedback when
becoming active during a break by flashing the break window border, the current
mode is visualized in the system tray icon, a "Restbreak now" button was added,
improved KDE support (native KDE applet and KDE sound events), added decent
tooltips for Workrave system tray icon, and lots of new translations (Basque,
Lithuanian, Portuguese, Norwegian, Czech, Hebrew).
