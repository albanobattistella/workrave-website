Thanks. I have RSI and find your program excellent. I have used two
other programs, 'Break time' and 'VDU tachograph', both of them are
badly designed.

Some things they do not do is:

1. They do not inform you when your next break is. 2. You cannot
postpone a break. 3. You cannot force the user to stop by blocking the
machine. 4. You measure activity, and NOT just time. Sometimes (with the
other software), when I take a 10 minute break and come back and sit
down it tells me to take a break!

Thanks again,
